# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

For this type of SSRF, the best evidence is usually a screenshot of incoming requests, and a summary of the data that was exfiltrated through exploitation.

Where possible and safe, escalate the SSRF to have some kind of tangible security impact, such as exfiltrating data. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC). If no impact can be demonstrated other than receiving external interactions, this will most likely be considered as P5/informational severity.
