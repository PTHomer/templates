# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For an infotainment vulnerability, please include detailed instructions that can be followed to easily demonstrate and reproduce the issue. If data was found using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), please provide steps to where and how it was found.

Attempt to completely stop the vehicle from functioning if the infotainment system controls a mechanical aspect of the vehicle. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept (PoC) here.
