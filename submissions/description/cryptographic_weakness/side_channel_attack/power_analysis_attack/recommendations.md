# Recommendation(s)

Implement robust entropy for the cryptographic algorithms and ensure that the algorithms, protocols, and keys in place are kept up to date. Best practices includes separating the power consumption of a system from the state of cryptographic operations. This ensures that the outcomes of a cryptographic step (or multiple steps) are not observable through the power consumption of the system.
