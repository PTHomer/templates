# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards.

Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature. For a CSRF vulnerability, please include a screenshot or video showing the successful execution of a CSRF POC code to perform some sensitive action. Please also include the proof of concept CSRF HTML code.

Attempt to escalate the lack of CSRF protection to perform an account takeover or some other sensitive action. If this is possible, provide a full Proof of Concept.
