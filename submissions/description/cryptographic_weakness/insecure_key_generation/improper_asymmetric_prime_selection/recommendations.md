# Recommendation(s)

Implement strong cryptography and keep up to date algorithms, protocols, and keys in place. For asymmetric prime number selection, ensure that there is a sufficient amount of prime numbers represented, and no mathematical relationship between each prime number selected. It is also best practice to use uniquely generated prime numbers for prime selection.
