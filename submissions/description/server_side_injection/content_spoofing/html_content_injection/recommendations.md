# Recommendation(s)

There is no single technique to protect from HTML content injection. However, the following best practices should be adhered to:

- Validate all input data, including that which is reflected by a request parameter
- Refrain from passing HTML data via request parameters. Properly encode the HTML before passing it through a request parameter if there is no other way.
- Refrain from displaying messages via request parameter. It is best practice to use temporary sessions instead.
