# Guidance

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough with a screenshot on how you exploited the vulnerability. This will speed triage time and result in faster rewards. Your submission must include evidence of the vulnerability and not be theoretical in nature.

To demonstrate access to sensitive information, self register two separate accounts and clearly demonstrate how you view the "victim" account information from the "attacker" account.

If identified, do not access or attempt to access sensitive information. Do not access Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as there are legal consequences to doing so.
